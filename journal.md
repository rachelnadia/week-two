# Reflection for Week 2



Digital work in the humanities is unique in structure. In terms of funding, most money comes from grants. However, as stated in the article 
'Making such bargain: Transcribe Bentham and the quality and cost-effectiveness of crowdsourced transcriptionâ€™, funding will not be given for something such as trancription alone. This is why digital history must involve effective collaboration. For Transcride Bentham, This meant the funding and support of the Transcription Desk and the collaborative work of the volunteers and editors.

This week, I got a much better grasp on the notion that digital history is a team effort. There were a few different ways in which I sought help this week and watch others work through their own work:

And even providing some tips when I felt confident enough to do so.
