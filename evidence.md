Goggled Solution: https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-activate-hypothesis-on-a-web-page/
- means that hypothesis does not have access to this page

Installation of Anaconda and Python successful!

The part that got me stuck first was I hadn't put wget.exe into my c:\windows folder on my PC. Fortunately, when I asked for help in the Discord server, Dr. Graham worked with me step by step.



I then continued to try the next part on my own. I created the folder in sublime text and pasted the links to the images. However, when I returned to the command prompt something didn't look right.

- so I decided to leave it for now and try again later
